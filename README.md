**Notifies** is a site that combines feeds from different sites such as Twitch.tv and Youtube.com into one feed/page.

## Feeds

### Twitch

Notifies auto refreshes the live Twitch feed every 2min when tab is focused. Notifies also shows the two most recent vods from specific Twitch channels that you have followed in Notifies (vod follows doesn't sync with Twitch). Auto refreches vods every 12hours, can be manually refreshed from a button.

### Youtube

Youtube feed shows the one latest uploaded video from each followed/subscribed channel in the past 3 days. Doesn't auto refresh, can be manually refreshed from a button.

#### Problems

-   Youtube feed doesn't live-streams (cost to much quota/requests)
-   123
